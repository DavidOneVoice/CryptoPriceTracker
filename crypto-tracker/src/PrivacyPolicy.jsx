      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how this website handles information when
        you visit. This platform does not collect personal information such as
        names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any form submission data.

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not request, store, or process any personally identifiable

        This website may use basic cookies or browser storage purely for
        improving user experience (for example, remembering preferences or

        information and cannot be used to identify you.

        If this site displays embedded content (such as videos, maps, or
        analytics), those external services may collect their own data. This
        Privacy Policy applies only to this website and not to any third-party
        platforms.
